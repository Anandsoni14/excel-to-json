# excel-to-csv
Command line utility to convert excel files (all of them) to csv. Uses Apache POI to convert files. I use this tool within php, since there are only implementation which are (a) too much memory consuming and/or slow. Or don't support all required excel formats. This tool uses https://poi.apache.org for reading the excel files. 

# usage
java -jar excel-to-csv [source]
